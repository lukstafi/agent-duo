| **Update Project Documentation** | [new_features.md](new_features.md) §5 (evolved from "Self-Rewriting Skills") |
| **Security / Isolated VMs** | [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) §Security Considerations |
| **Multi-Agent Debate** | Already implemented (merge vote/debate phase) |
| **Human-in-the-Loop Approval** | Already implemented (clarify, pushback, escalation) |

| **Sub-Agent Spawning** | Superseded by pai-lite Mayor's Task tool delegation |
| **Memory Synthesis** | Superseded by pai-lite Mayor's `/learn` and `/sync-learnings` |
| **CI Feedback Loop** | Superseded by pai-lite CI Failure Adapter |
| **Progressive Autonomy** | Deferred (pai-lite has fixed autonomy levels per action) |
| **Swarm Migration** | Not pursued (parallelizing work leads to wasted tokens) |
| **Tree-of-Thought** | Out of scope (belongs to model architectures or native agent harnesses) |
| **Verbose Reasoning** | Partially covered by pai-lite journal/notifications |
| **Action Caching & Replay** | Deferred |
